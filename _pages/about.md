<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, Nice to meet you! My name is **Yu He**. I'm currently a _third-year_ undergraduate student at School of Intelligent Software and Engineering, <a href='nju.edu.cn'>Nanjing University (NJU)</a>. I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://lukexuke.github.io/'>Prof. Ke Xu</a>, and to collaborate closely with <a href='https://wenchao.li/#about_me'>Dr. Wenchao Li</a>. My time working with them has been both memorable and formative for my research journey.

My research interest lies, broadly, in **Big-Data Intelligence Analytics**, **Visualization**,**Human Computer Interaction with AI**. More specifically, I am interested in:

- Building interactive and visually guided AI systems for exploring complex networks and multimodal data.
- Evaluating and selecting data through interactive interfaces to better understand the trade-offs between generalization and robustness in machine learning models.

I'm actively seeking potential research internship opportunity in the United States, Mainland China and Hong Kong. I'm also open to _Research Collaborations_! If my background aligns with your interests or if you have positions for **Summer Research Intern 2026** or any interesting topics, I would be very happy to connect. Feel free to reach out to me, let's go together to **Make the Impossible Possible and the Possible Easy.**

# 🔥 News

ESSR: Ebbinghaus Sampler and Scheduler Brought LLM’s Memory Back

Yiyang Lu, **Yu He**, Jie Wang, Lin Yang, Hanzhu Chen, Jianye Hao

_ESSR is a cognitive-inspired continual learning framework that models LLM memory strength based on a survival-form forgetting curve. By scheduling adaptive replay for vulnerable samples, ESSR effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in online fine-tuning scenarios._
